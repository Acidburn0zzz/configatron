=Configatron

Configatron makes configuring your applications and scripts incredibly easy. No longer is a there a need to use constants or global variables. Now you can use a simple and painless system to configure your life. And, because it's all Ruby, you can do any crazy thing you would like to!

==Examples

===Simple
  configatron do |config|
    config.email = "mark@mackframework.com"
    config.database_url = "postgres://localhost/mack_framework_rocks"
    # etc...
  end
  
Now, anywhere in your code you can do the following:

  configatron.email # => "mark@mackframework.com"
  configatron.database_url # => "postgres://localhost/mack_framework_rocks"

Viola! Simple as can be.

Now you're saying, what if I want to have a 'default' set of options, but then override them later, based on other information? Simple again. Let's use our above example. We've configured our 'database_url' option to be "postgres://localhost/mack_framework_rocks". The problem with that is that is our production database url, not our development url. Fair enough, all you have to do is redeclare it:

  configatron do |config|
    config.database_url = "postgres://localhost/mack_framework_rocks_development"
  end
  
becomes:

  configatron.email # => "mark@mackframework.com"
  configatron.database_url # => "postgres://localhost/mack_framework_rocks_development"
  
Notice how our other configuration parameters haven't changed? Cool, eh?

===Namespaces

The question that should be on your lips is what I need to have namespaced configuration parameters. It's easy! Configatron allows you to create namespaces.

  configatron do |config|
    config.website_url = "http://www.mackframework.com"
    config.email do |email|
      email.pop do |pop|
        pop.address = "pop.example.com"
        pop.port = "110"
        # etc ...
      end
      email.smtp do |smtp|
        smtp.address = "smtp.example.com"
        smtp.port = "25"
        # etc ...
      end
    end
    # etc...
  end

becomes:

  configatron.email.pop.address # => "pop.example.com"
  configatron.email.smtp.address # => "smtp.example.com"
  configatron.website_url # => "http://www.mackframework.com"
  
Configatron allows you to nest namespaces to your hearts content! Just keep going, it's that easy.

Enjoy!
